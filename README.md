# Custom LazyVim config

## Prerequisites
Make sure `ripgrep` is installed for Telescope to work properly

## Lazygit
For the best experience, make sure Lazygit is installed, see [Lazygit repository](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit). For ease of access, here are some commonly used shortcuts:
- `<leader>gg` - Open Lazygit
- `<C-/` - Close Lazygit
- `<S-p>` - Push code

## PHP Xdebug
Install vscode-php-debug in ~/dev/

- git clone https://github.com/xdebug/vscode-php-debug.git
- cd vscode-php-debug
- npm install && npm run build

If you have not configured Xdebug, read Installation at vscode-php-debug.
